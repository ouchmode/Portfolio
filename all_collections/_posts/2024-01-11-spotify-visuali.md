The goal of this project was to practice Power BI and strengthen my skills in Python a bit. Learned more about creating and applying functions as well as optimizing the dataset by setting appropriate datatypes. This didn't really matter in the end since Excel / Power BI messed with them anyway. I hadn't thought about that beforehand, but it was still fun to learn and apply it to something.
