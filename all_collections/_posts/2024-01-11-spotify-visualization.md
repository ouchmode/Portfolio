The goal of this project was to practice Power BI and strengthen my skills in Python a bit. Learned more about creating and applying functions as well as optimizing the dataset by setting appropriate datatypes. This didn't really matter in the end since Excel / Power BI messed with them anyway. I hadn't thought about that beforehand, but it was still fun to learn and apply it to something.

## **Default View**
- Header contains a few KPI metrics *(# of Tracks, Most Popular Track, Avg. Danceability)* as well as the title of the visual.
- Option to filter by genre via list (originally a dropdown but it seems you can't change the height of the list that appears when you click it).
- Matrix based on Popularity and Loudness and how they may possibly correlate.
- Radial chart for the Explicit column to show how many songs are Explicit / Non-Explicit. Has a bit more meaning when broken down by clicking data points on other charts.
