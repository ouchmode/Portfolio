title: SM64 Speedruns - A Python & SQL Project
date: 2023-12-23
categories: ["jekyll", "python", "sql"]

This project was made after getting into Python in November '23 (mostly utilizing the Pandas module). I also wanted to work on my SQL skills a bit so after doing research and writing notes I was able to come up with this project. You can [view it here.](https://github.com/ouchmode/SM64-Speedrun-Data).

The only thing this project doesn't deal with is multiple tables. This dataset isn't complex, but I wanted to use something fun and relatable to me since I used to indulge in speedrunning a couple of years.

```py
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require("./lang/" + l);
  return true;
};
```
